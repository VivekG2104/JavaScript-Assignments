            <h1>Welcome to My Travel Blog!</h1>
            <I>I originally decided to start this travel blog to share useful tips and tricks I have learned while traveling. However, as I started digging into my travels, I realized how much fun it is to relive some of our adventures. We have had some laughs over the years and learned a lot. <br> I will try to keep my posts short, but no promises.  I don’t know where this journey will take me, but I am excited to start this new adventure of blogging. </p>

            <br>
    <p>
        I recently fulfilled my dream of visiting Nashik! This fascinating city is a truly a waterfall of extremes.
    </p>
    <p>Nashik is a beautiful city in Maharashtra that offers serenity at its best and is a culturally rich destination.There are various waterfalls near Nashik that will rejuvenate your soul. These waterfalls are situated in exotic locations as they originate from Brahmagiri hill and Trimbakeshwar hill of the Sahyadri Mountain Ranges. </p>
    <p> Some highlights from my trip:</p>

    <ul type="soul">
        <li>Vihigaon waterfall is a picturesque waterfall near Nashik, which drops from a 120-ft height from the Sahyadri Mountain Ranges. This waterfall looks amazing even from a distance.</li>

    <h3><p class="post-meta">Fort in Pune</p></h3>
    <p>I recently fulfilled my dream of visiting Pune! This fascinating city is a truly a fort of extremes.</p>
    <p>Pune, located in the state of Maharashtra, India, is known as the "Queen of the Deccan". It is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples and has a rich historical past as the former capital of the Bhonsle Marathas. </p>
    <p>Some highlights from my trip:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sinhgad Fort - Situated around 36 km southwest of Pune city, this fort is nestled on the Bhuleshwar range of the Sahyadris. Apart from its impeccable landscapes, the renowned fort of Sinhagad is also known for its rich history which will take you back to the ancient era.
        </li>
        <br>
